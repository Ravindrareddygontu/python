'''A Truck is a Car but with the additional behaviours.
Inherit the Car class into Truck class and build the additional features.

Truck Car have following attributes and methods
Attributes:
color,max_speed,acceeleration,tyre_friction,is_engine_started,current_speed,nitro
note: nitro is race_car attributes as child attribute

Methods:
start_engine,stop_engine,accelerate,apply_breaks,sound_horn
Sample Input
Checking Default Tests
Sample Output
False

â€¢ You can copy the implementation of Car class from
the previous set and add new features on top of
that code.
